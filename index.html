    <h1>Hi, I'm nmac101</h1>
    <p>I make things. A lot of them.</p>
    <p>You can check all my stuff below:</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/nmac101/browseq"><img src="browseq.png" alt="browseq"></a>
    <h2>browseq</h2>
    <p>browseq (or "browse?") is a browser made for the htmlhelp tool included in Windows. It's the smallest browser ever I guess (11 kb). It only runs pages from 2010 or earlier.</p>

    <h2>GoodOldFox</h2>
    <p>Don't like the new Firefox design? Well, this is for you. This helps you download an old Firefox version. All downloads are made from the official Mozilla FTP server.</p>

    <h2>Mission In Snowdriftland</h2>
    <p>Revive your memories with this once claimed lost game. You'll need Flash Player installed, as there are some minor bugs with Ruffle. I downloaded the files from the Internet Archive, made some changes to the webpage, and put them here, for anyone who wants to play.</p>
